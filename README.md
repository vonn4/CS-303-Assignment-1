The user is presented with a menu that has 6 option from which they can choose:
1. Print the contents of the array
2. Search for a certain number which the user will be prompted for in the array. 
3. Change a number at a certain index in the array and the user will be prompted to give the index and the new value.
4. Add a number to the back of the array which will only work if the array has enough room. 
5. Remove a number at a certain index from the array, which will either remove that number from that space, or add a zero to that space. 
6. This will make the user quit the program.
